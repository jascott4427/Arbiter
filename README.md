capture the flag and ememy avoidance robot path planning algorithm

Potentially for enemy path, give them a voronoi diagram of the map and they can create the patrol route by at every intersection, choosing a randdom direction then they turn and continue til next intersection. This can be calculated before hand and plotted separately so we can test with randomly generating paths
